          Understanding the difference between a fraudulent credit repair agency and a
          trusted transparent one is a difficulty for many individuals because so many are
          scams. They give clients the run around with sneaky sales tactics and donâ€™t
          deliver any results leading to many clients wasting their time and most
          importantly their money. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re happy to be partnered with ASAP Credit
          Repair, a transparent agency who delivers results along with a 4.5 star rating
          on facebook and a 4.9 star rating on Google respectfully. As many of our clients
          may not meet the minimum requirements due to inquiries, foreclosures,
          bankruptcies etc. We work with ASAP Credit Repair to help clear derogatory
          information with some clients getting finished as soon as 40 days. Also offering
          a money back guarantee if no results are seen in a 60 or 90 day period.

          We are also partnered with IDIQ to deliver credit/ identity monitoring along
          with instant access to all 3 major credit bureau reports. 9 Million Americans
          lose their identity each year and every day more complain about random inquiries
          and such on their credit history because they haven't checked prior and thus
          this ruins future plans so it's a very good tool to have. With plans as low as
          $9.99 a month.
