Understanding which financing options that are a possibility for you and your business is key along with having more options on the table. Yet standard bank institutions don’t fare too well in this regard. By having a long funding eta and limited options it becomes difficult for small businesses to secure funding. Yet with alternative lenders the options are far more and with approval time being very swift. Before we get into the four advantages of alternative lending let first take a look at what alternative lending is. 

**What is alternative lending?**

In short alternative lending is any funding or financing outside of the traditional bank system. Alternative lenders are typically online based private companies that have affiliations with banks. Yet lenders are always going to have different rates because underwriting guidelines are not so strict amongst alternative lenders. 

In addition with alternative lending the rates might be slightly higher than banks yet banks are difficult to qualify for in regards to credit score, cash flow, time etc. There are endless benefits with alternative lending. Let's get into the top 4! 

**Speed and Ease of Application**

With technology that quickly processes bank statements and analyzes cash flow, underwriters make their job simple in the funding process. Delivering results in as quick as a few hours yet some options like an SBA loan that is a government backed loan naturally will take longer. 

With no face to face interactions there isn’t a need for many papers to be turned in by hand. Also allowing for e-signatures makes the process even more streamline. With time being one of the biggest commodities in the world it's nice to know you won’t spend much time on an application. 

**Quick Turnaround Time**

The application time is quick with little to no document collection required for pre-approval. You may wait weeks to hear from a bank and still be told no. 

So if you're in need of funding quickly or just need a line of credit alternative lending is a great option for you.

**Flexibility**

With looser restrictions there comes more leniency upon underwriters with many business owners who have not qualified for funding through banks may hear that yes they desire. With there being many different lenders and each having different qualification guidelines is the reason why we here at X Capital work with many different lenders to offer our clients as many options as possible.  

**Diversity of Funding Options**

With looser restrictions there naturally comes more options with funding, with more options a business owner is able to gain funding like he/she never imagined. Funding through real estate, lines of credit, and MCA’s are just a few options to name. 

There are many different options and understanding which works best for your business is something we're happy to do! If you need funding for your business give X Capital Business Consultants a call, we’re here to help you grow!
